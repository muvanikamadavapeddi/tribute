        Born in the Republic of Florence in 1511, Giorgio Vasari was in prime
        position to watch the Renaissance unfurl over the course of the
        sixteenth century. He was not happy, however, to be a passive spectator.
        He involved himself in all manner of artistic developments and built a
        wide circle of influential friends around him. Discover more about the
        father of art history over the following 10 facts.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Vasari was first and foremost a frugal businessman. He realized the
            part "artistic influence" could play in elevating the value attached
            to an artwork. His position helped initiate a shift in thinking that
            saw painters - or, rather, some special painters - occupy a higher
            status than mere artisan. If one could present themselves as an
            artist, then the greater their chances of achieving fame and
            financial security. His position was summed up in this remarkable
            address to his erstwhile colleagues and masters:
            <i
              >"Once I was poor like all of you but now I have three thousand
              scudi or more. You considered me awkward (as a painter), but the
              friars and priests consider me an able master. Once I served you,
              and now I have a servant of my own, who looks after my horse. I
              used to dress in those rags worn by poor painters, and now I am
              dressed in velvet. Once I went on foot, and now I go on
              horseback."</i
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Vasari gained early notices for his commissioned portraiture. He
            favoured pastel tones to bring out a humanist and sympathetic
            quality in his venerated sitters. To the ends of posterity, he would
            also pepper his picture frame with symbolism that would connote the
            gravitas and status of the individual in question.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having invested in the ideals of tonal harmony in his portraits,
            Vasari turned towards the techniques of Mannerism in his religious
            painting. These compositions relied more on artifice - unnatural
            colors, abnormalities in, and elongations of, scale, exaggerations
            in contrast and so on - with the intent of creating a sense of high
            elegance and heightened drama within the picture narrative.
          </li>
          <li>
            As author of The Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and
            Architects (Volume one: 1550; Volume two: 1568) Vasari effectively
            gave birth to a populist art history. It was by coming to understand
            the life and times of the Florentine and Venetian masters, Vasari
            believed, that one could get to the essence of Renaissance art. The
            book followed in fact an already established tradition in
            biographical writing, but Vasari brought a new anecdotal edge to
            proceedings while at times supplying a moral judgment on the
            activities of the artists in question. Many scholars have criticized
            The Lives for its biases and its surfeit of factual inaccuracies and
            embellishments. But the principle that the history of art (and
            literature for that matter) could be understood through the
            exceptional deeds of divinely gifted individuals has stood firm. It
            is quite true that many radicals and revisionists have produced
            treaties that challenge this romanticized, "bourgeois", approach to
            art history, but it is the idea of the
            <i><u>"biographical legend"</u></i> that has done most to promote
            the pleasures of art appreciation across all classes of art lovers.
